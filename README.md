My first website with **JavaScript**

## Operation of the web

This page is a cocktail search engine that allows you to create a list of favorite cocktails.

How to proceed:

- Search for the cocktail you want in the search bar.
- A list of cocktails containing the written words/letters will appear. It detects uppercase, lowercase, letter/word matches.
- We can click on the drink we want to add it to the list of favorites, which will be saved in local storage for future searches.
- We can remove any drink from our favorites list using the following three options:
- Click on the trash can icon next to the drink in the favorites list.
- Click on the drink in the main list.
- We can delete all favorite items by selecting "X".
- Pressing the reset button will delete all data from the lists, search engine, and local storage. In addition, the web page will be refreshed.

## How this website has been created:

- Modifying the DOM from JavaScript
- Creating fetch requests and promises
- Managing information in JSON format
- Working with server response
- Working with data listings: arrays [] and objects {}
- Using conditionals
- Using functions to structure the code
- Listening to the DOM and acting accordingly
- Using LocalStorage to store information in the browser

#### What has been used for the project?:

- In this project, a basic HTML structure has been created: The index.html has been divided into files: header, main, footer.
- To give style and visual appeal to the website, SASS has been used: The Main.sccs file is divided into: header, page, and footer.
- To enable interaction with the website, JavaScript has been used: You can find it in the JS - main.js folder.
- AJAX and APIs have been used to make requests to the server, but not only that, JSON has been used to work with the collected information. Additionally, LocalStorage has been used to save information about favorite cocktails.

#### Things to keep in mind about the repository:

- The `src/` folder contains the files for our website, such as HTML, CSS, JS...
- The `public/` and `docs/` folders are generated
